## **Introduction**

The honeygain is an option that allows users to earn money by sharing your traffic.

You'll receive $0.10 for the 1G traffic you share, and this script just supports home bandwidth.

It has below features:

1. Automatically install docker based on the system, and if docker are already installed, it will not installed again.

2. Automatically select and build the pulled docker image according to the architecture, without the need for you to manually modify the official case.

3. Use Watchtower for automatic mirror update without manual update and re-entry of parameters.

(Watchtower is a utility that automates the updating of Docker images and containers. It monitors all running containers and related images, and automatically pulls the latest image and uses parameters when initially deployed to restart the corresponding container.)

## Experience

The platform does not allow data center traffic, so it can only be shared using home bandwidth or similar.

**It must be noted that this hanger must be 100% sure that you are a home broadband server, or that the traffic of your home computer can be hung directly, but others cannot. If you hang up too much, you will be banned!**
